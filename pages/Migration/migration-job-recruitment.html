                        We will direct you to institutions near you to learn

                        is a non-English speaking country, it is required to
                        translate all your documents to German for the German
                        authority to evaluate your certificates. After that, we

                        verification, and that process will take around 2 to 3
                        months to issue your registration to work as a licensed
                        nurse. After that, we will send your verified and
