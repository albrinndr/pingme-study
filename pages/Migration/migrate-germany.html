                        Germany job seeker visa is issued for 6 months during

                        time, your visa changes to a work permit. The following

                        Visa processing will take a time of 2 to 3 weeks

                        Hence, always preparing well in advance is the best
                        option. Otherwise, it will take more time to process
                        your visa application, and it might ruin your plans. For
                        applying for a visa at the embassy, you have to pay Rs â€”
                        4200 as a processing fee. The fee has to be paid at the
                        embassy itself. You will receive a receipt of the
                        payment when you receive your processed application.
