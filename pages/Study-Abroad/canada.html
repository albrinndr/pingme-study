                        The smooth process for a permanent residence permit

                      <p class="p">
                        Getting a permanent residence permit is a very
                        straightforward process in Canada. If you have skilled
                        job experience during your Post Graduate Work Permit,
                        you can apply for permanent residency through the
                        Canadian Experience Class (CEC). Certain provinces in
                        Canada, like British Columbia and Quebec, allows
                        students to apply for permanent residency directly
                        without any job offers under certain conditions. The
                        family reunion options are also very attractive for
                        international students and job seekers.

                      <p class="p">
                        Compared to many countries, the cost of studying in
                        Canada is very affordable. You will likely need between
                        C$20,000 and C$30,000 annually to cover tuition and
                        living expenses. However, this cost range is an average
                        only and will vary according to the institution and
                        program in which you are enrolled, your location and
                        your living expenses.
                      </p>
                      <p class="p">
                        Most of the universities in Canada offer on-campus
                        housing for international students. But students have to
                        separately apply for this. Usually, this will cost
                        around $3000 -$7000 per school year. Some students also
                        choose to live off-campus. This will be expensive
                        obviously ranging from $500 – $1500 per month. In
                        addition to this, you will have to pay monthly for
                        utilities like electricity, home phone, internet, and
                        television as well as personal expenses and renters’
                        expenses.

                      <p class="p">
                        The highly advanced transportation system in the cities
                        can be used by the students for their short errands.
                        These monthly passes will range from $80 -$110. And some
                        of them will have student offers too.
