                        Sweden is a country that does not follow any of the
                        conventional education methods. Rather than
                        spoon-feeding the students with the pre-structured
                        syllabus, they let the students learn things from an
                        individual perspective. This mode of education has
                        resulted in some of the most famous inventions from
                        students in the country.
